# SwarmEngine
Open Source game engine, using OpenGL as the main renderer.

This project contains multiple sub-projects. When built using CMake, the result will be a Core static library to build with, as well as sample Test applications designed to demonstrate different features of the engine.

This engine is a Capstone project for CSCE, but development is planned to continue after completion of Capstone.
